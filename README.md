Description:  
The simple ecommerce mall website using Vue.js and Java Spring boot.

- ViewProducts.vue: Render and display all products.
- AddProducts.vue: For admin to add new product.
- UpdateProducts.vue: For user to purchase products and place order.
- ViewOrders.vue: For user to check their orders and amount of order.

Few future improvements and unfinished tasks:
- Add login mechanism, since now everyone can add new items, and don't have to login before you place the order. 
- Finish table "orderdetail", and let users check their order details.
- Add @Transactional for multiple database modifications.
- Add SQL injection prevention.
